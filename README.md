The breakout game is the game which we reflect a moving ball by bar.If we break all block by ball, it is game clear.However, when you drop a ball, it is game over.In my game, if you be game over or game clear it will make a reset button and you can do 1 more time.

## Note / Dear CS50 Learner
I install pygame in CS50IDE ,but it doesn’t work.I did in ~/project/.However, there is a error says “No available video device”. I use the reddit to solve problem but I can solve so I use IDLE to make this game.

If you know how to move pygame in CS50 IDE, please tell me in the comment.
